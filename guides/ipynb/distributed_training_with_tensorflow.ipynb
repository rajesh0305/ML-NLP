    "## Single-host, multi-device synchronous training\n",
    "\n",
    "In this setup, you have one machine with several GPUs on it (typically 2 to 16). Each\n",
    "device will run a copy of your model (called a **replica**). For simplicity, in what\n",
    "follows, we'll assume we're dealing with 8 GPUs, at no loss of generality.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works**\n",
    "\n",
    "At each step of training:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The current batch of data (called **global batch**) is split into 8 different\n",
    "sub-batches (called **local batches**). For instance, if the global batch has 512\n",
    "samples, each of the 8 local batches will have 64 samples.\n",
    "- Each of the 8 replicas independently processes a local batch: they run a forward pass,\n",
    "then a backward pass, outputting the gradient of the weights with respect to the loss of\n",
    "the model on the local batch.\n",
    "- The weight updates originating from local gradients are efficiently merged across the 8\n",
    "replicas. Because this is done at the end of every step, the replicas always stay in\n",
    "sync.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, the process of synchronously updating the weights of the model replicas is\n",
    "handled at the level of each individual weight variable. This is done through a **mirrored\n",
    "variable** object.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to use it**\n",
    "\n",
    "To do single-host, multi-device synchronous training with a Keras model, you would use\n",
    "the [`tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy` API](\n",
    "    https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/distribute/MirroredStrategy).\n",
    "Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Instantiate a `MirroredStrategy`, optionally configuring which specific devices you\n",
    "want to use (by default the strategy will use all GPUs available).\n",
    "- Use the strategy object to open a scope, and within this scope, create all the Keras\n",
    "objects you need that contain variables. Typically, that means **creating & compiling the\n",
    "model** inside the distribution scope. In some cases, the first call to `fit()` may also\n",
    "create variables, so it's a good idea to put your `fit()` call in the scope as well.\n",
    "- Train the model via `fit()` as usual.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, we recommend that you use `tf.data.Dataset` objects to load data\n",
    "in a multi-device or distributed workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Schematically, it looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Create a MirroredStrategy.\n",
    "strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()\n",
    "print('Number of devices: {}'.format(strategy.num_replicas_in_sync))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Open a strategy scope.\n",
    "with strategy.scope():\n",
    "    # Everything that creates variables should be under the strategy scope.\n",
    "    # In general this is only model construction & `compile()`.\n",
    "    model = Model(...)\n",
    "    model.compile(...)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Train the model on all available devices.\n",
    "    model.fit(train_dataset, validation_data=val_dataset, ...)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Test the model on all available devices.\n",
