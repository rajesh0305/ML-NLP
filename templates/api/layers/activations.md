# Layer activation functions


## Usage of activations

Activations can either be used through an `Activation` layer, or through the `activation` argument supported by all forward layers:

```python
model.add(layers.Dense(64, activation=activations.relu))
```

This is equivalent to:

```python
from keras import layers
from keras import activations

model.add(layers.Dense(64))
model.add(layers.Activation(activations.relu))
```

All built-in activations may also be passed via their string identifier:

```python
model.add(layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'))
```

## Creating custom activations

You can also use a callable as an activation
(in this case it should take a tensor and return a tensor of the same shape and dtype):

```python
model.add(layers.Dense(64, activation=keras.ops.tanh))
```

## About "advanced activation" layers

Activations that are more complex than a simple function (eg. learnable activations, which maintain a state)
are available as [Advanced Activation layers](/api/layers/activation_layers/).
